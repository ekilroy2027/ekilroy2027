<!--Elizabeth Kilroy-->
## ⁉️ Who am I ⁉️:
I originated from Boston, MA, but I now reside in Atlanta. Currently, I am studying Graphics Information Technology at ASU. I have worked in the printing industry for several years and am now eager to learn web and social media design to enhance my skills as a graphic designer, and to bring these skills to you.


## 👋 I’m currently __________:
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my Shutterstock Contributor page, where I created simple and generic Christmas background designs. I will be posting livelier content in November this year, so stay tuned. My goal is to release a new set of graphics every quarter.      
- 🌱 I am currently learning how to design for the internet and social media devices.

## 📣 Coming Attractions:
In the spring of 2025, I will start an internship in social media design. I will also be launching a Behance page sometime in the same year.
